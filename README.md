## Very simple repo structure explanation
This repository structure is built the following way:
* Each task has its own folder named H (homework) + task number
* In each folder there is a **main.py** file, **addons** folder (with either libraries, data or custom-written scripts) and a **README.md** explaining the solution and results.
